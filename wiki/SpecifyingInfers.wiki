= What are inferred relationships? =

An inferred relationship is a relationship which is dynamically created on an as-needed basis. For example, if a predicate needs a relationship `Foo(x, y)` to be true, but it is not true or false in the current context, the analysis will check the inferred relationships to see if a `Foo(x, y)` can be dynamically inferred.

Inferred relationships may not conflict with the context, and are ignored and not used when they do.

=Examples=
Inferred relationships are written using the `@Infer` class annotation. To make several of them, use the `@Infers` annotation.

{{{
@Infer(
	trigger = "Items(list, ctrl) AND Item(item, list)",
	effects = {"Child(item, ctrl)"}
)
}}}

The infer annotation has two parts:
  * The trigger predicate describes when the effects can be inferred
  * The list of effects described what may be dynamically inferred when the trigger is true

=Syntax=
The syntax is the same as for [SpecifyingConstraints constraints].
