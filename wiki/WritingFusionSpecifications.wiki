= FUSION specs =
The pages below describe the 5 types of FUSION specifications. The first three are integral to get anything usable working.

Througout these pages, the keyword "target" refers to the receiver object, and "result" refers to the returned object. Therefore, in the following example:

{{{x = y.foo(z)}}}

{{{x}}} is the result, and {{{y}}} is the target of the method. If we are looking at it from the perspective of the declaration:

{{{
public class Foo {
   public Bar foo(Baz z) {...}
}
}}}

then the "this" object (of type Foo) is the target, and the returned object (of type Bar) is the result.
