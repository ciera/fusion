#summary How to specify FUSION Constraints

= Specifying Constraints =
Constraints are written as a class-level Java 5 annotation. An example is shown below.

{{{
@Constraint(
	op="ListItem.setSelected(boolean selected) : void",
	trigger = "!selected AND Child(target, ctrl) AND ctrl instanceof DropDownList",
	requires = "Selected(target)",
	effects = {"!CorrectlySelected(ctrl)"}
)
}}}

A constraint has 4 parts:
  # The operator being constrained
  # The trigger predicate
  # The requires predicate
  # The effects list

The first 3 parts are written as Strings, and the last is an array of Strings. (While not ideal, this is due to the limitations of Java 5 annotations.) The syntax of these strings is described below.
